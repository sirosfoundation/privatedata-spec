# SIROS Wallet Private Data Blob Specification (Normative)

Version: 2.1  
Date: 2026-08-28  
Status: Normative (reference implementation aligned)

## 1. Scope and Source of Truth

This document defines the normative format and processing rules for the wallet private data blob ("privateData"), which contains encrypted wallet state including credential key material and credentials.

The canonical source of truth is the web wallet implementation in `wallet-frontend`.

If any SDK behavior differs from this document, the `wallet-frontend` behavior is normative.

## 2. Normative Language

The terms MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, and MAY are to be interpreted as in RFC 2119.

## 3. Blob Transport and Encoding

### 3.1 Stored backend field

`privateData` is stored as a serialized UTF-8 JSON container blob.

### 3.2 HTTP transport

- `POST /user/session/private-data` MUST receive the serialized container bytes.
- `GET /user/session/private-data` returns JSON with `privateData` encoded as tagged binary:

```json
{
  "privateData": { "$b64u": "<base64url(container-json-bytes)>" }
}
```

### 3.3 Tagged binary representation

Binary fields in JSON MUST be encoded as:

```json
{ "$b64u": "<base64url-no-padding>" }
```

This applies both to the top-level response payload wrapper and binary fields inside the container.

## 4. Container Model

The current normative output format is the asymmetric encapsulation container:

```json
{
  "mainKey": { ... },
  "prfKeys": [ ... ],
  "jwe": "<compact-jwe>"
}
```

### 4.1 Top-level fields

- `mainKey` MUST be present in newly written containers.
- `prfKeys` MUST be present (possibly empty).
- `jwe` MUST be present and MUST be a compact JWE string.

### 4.2 `mainKey`

`mainKey` defines how a content-encryption main AES key is decapsulated by PRF entries.

`mainKey.publicKey.importKey` MUST contain:

- `format`: `"raw"`
- `keyData`: tagged binary, uncompressed P-256 point (65 bytes)
- `algorithm.name`: `"ECDH"`
- `algorithm.namedCurve`: `"P-256"`

`mainKey.unwrapKey` MUST contain:

- `format`: `"raw"`
- `unwrapAlgo`: `"AES-KW"`
- `unwrappedKeyAlgo.name`: `"AES-GCM"`
- `unwrappedKeyAlgo.length`: `256`

### 4.3 `prfKeys[]`

Each PRF key entry corresponds to one WebAuthn credential.

Required fields:

- `credentialId` (tagged binary)
- `prfSalt` (32 bytes tagged binary)
- `hkdfSalt` (32 bytes tagged binary)
- `hkdfInfo` (tagged binary, normative value below)
- `keypair` (encapsulation keypair)
- `unwrapKey` (wrapped main key)

Optional fields:

- `transports`
- `algorithm` (if present, MUST be AES-GCM 256)

`keypair.publicKey.importKey` and `keypair.privateKey.unwrapKey` MUST encode ECDH P-256 keypair material as in the reference.

`unwrapKey.wrappedKey` MUST be AES-KW wrapped main key bytes.

## 5. Cryptographic Processing

## 5.1 PRF-derived key

Given WebAuthn PRF output (`prfOutput`), derive PRF wrapping key:

- HKDF hash: SHA-256
- IKM: PRF output
- salt: `hkdfSalt`
- info: `hkdfInfo`
- output length: 32 bytes

Normative default info string is UTF-8 `"eDiplomas PRF"`.

## 5.2 Main key decapsulation flow

1. Decrypt `keypair.privateKey.unwrapKey.wrappedKey` with PRF key using AES-GCM (`unwrapAlgo.iv`).
2. Import resulting ECDH private key (JWK).
3. ECDH with `mainKey.publicKey`.
4. Use derived secret as AES-KW key material (256-bit key).
5. Unwrap `prfKeys[i].unwrapKey.wrappedKey` to obtain main key.

## 5.3 Payload encryption

`jwe` MUST use:

- `alg`: `A256GCMKW`
- `enc`: `A256GCM`

The decrypted plaintext MUST be UTF-8 JSON WalletStateContainer (Section 6).

## 6. JWE Plaintext: WalletStateContainer

The plaintext JSON MUST follow the event-sourced wallet schema used by `wallet-frontend`:

```json
{
  "lastEventHash": "...",
  "events": [ ... ],
  "S": {
    "schemaVersion": 3,
    "credentials": [ ... ],
    "keypairs": [ ... ],
    "presentations": [ ... ],
    "settings": { "openidRefreshTokenMaxAgeInSeconds": "..." },
    "credentialIssuanceSessions": [ ... ]
  }
}
```

Normative requirements:

- `S.schemaVersion` MUST be `3` for newly written state.
- `events` and `lastEventHash` MUST be preserved as authored unless explicitly folded/merged by event logic.
- `S.keypairs[].keypair.privateKey` MUST contain JWK private key material for ES256 signing keys.
- `S.credentials[]` entries MUST preserve wallet metadata fields (`format`, `kid`, `instanceId`, `batchId`, `credentialIssuerIdentifier`, `credentialConfigurationId`).
- `S.settings.openidRefreshTokenMaxAgeInSeconds` MUST be preserved.
- `presentations` and `credentialIssuanceSessions` MUST be preserved.

### 6.1 `S.extensions`

Clients MAY carry state this specification does not define, under a single
namespaced field. `S.extensions` is an object keyed by **namespace**; each
namespace is an object keyed by **entry key**; each value is an opaque
string.

```json
"extensions": {
  "org.siros.wscd": { "kid-a1b2": "<opaque>", "kid-c3d4": "<opaque>" },
  "org.siros.bbs":  { "1849302113": "<opaque>" }
}
```

Namespaces are reverse-DNS strings, registered in §6.1.7. Registration is a
change to this document.

- Readers MUST NOT interpret a value in a namespace they do not own.
- Readers MUST preserve namespaces and extension events they do not
  recognise. An unrecognised namespace is not an error.

*Non-normative illustration:*

```typescript
type Extensions = Record<Namespace, Record<EntryKey, OpaqueValue>>;
type WalletStateV3 = { /* … */ extensions?: Extensions };
```

#### 6.1.1 Entry keys

For a namespace in `lww` mode (§6.1.2), an entry key MUST identify a single
entity the wallet already tracks — a key identifier, a credential
identifier, a batch identifier. An entry key MUST NOT name a subsystem, a
plugin, or a category.

An `events`-mode namespace defines its own state shape and is not bound by
this rule.

*Non-normative illustration — the rule exists because resolution is
per key:*

```typescript
// Conformant: two devices enrolling two authenticators write disjoint keys.
const ok: Extensions = {
  "org.siros.wscd": { "kid-a1b2": "…", "kid-c3d4": "…" },
};

// Non-conformant: one entry for the whole plugin. Concurrent writes collide
// on a single key, and last-write-wins discards one authenticator.
const notOk: Extensions = {
  "org.siros.wscd": { "fido2": "…" },
};
```

#### 6.1.2 Merge modes

A namespace declares its merge mode at registration. Two modes are defined.

**`lww`** (default). State is a map from entry key to opaque value.
Resolution is last-write-wins per `(namespace, key)`. A client MAY merge and
fold an `lww` namespace without understanding its values.

**`events`**. The namespace defines its own event types, reduction and merge
semantics.

- A client that does not support the namespace MUST retain its events, MUST
  ignore them when folding, and MUST NOT fold them into `S`.
- Only a client that supports the namespace may fold them.
- The namespace MUST specify its own event ordering.

A namespace SHOULD use `lww` unless whole-entry replacement would lose
information.

*Non-normative illustration — a client without support retains and ignores,
rather than dropping or failing:*

```typescript
function reduce(state: WalletState, e: WalletSessionEvent): WalletState {
  if (isExtensionEvent(e) && !supports(e.namespace)) {
    // Retained in `events` by the caller; contributes nothing to `S`, and
    // MUST NOT be folded away by this client.
    return state;
  }
  return applyKnown(state, e);
}
```

#### 6.1.3 Size

- A namespace's state size MUST be proportional to entities the user can
  enumerate and delete.
- A namespace MUST NOT grow its state with the number of events. An entry
  value MUST NOT accumulate an append-only history.
- Deleting the entity an entry key names MUST delete the entry.

Implementations SHOULD report per-namespace sizes.

#### 6.1.4 Events, reduction and merge

Extension state MUST be written as events. For an `lww` namespace the event
type is `set_extension`:

```json
{
  "type": "set_extension",
  "schemaVersion": 3,
  "eventId": 1234,
  "parentHash": "…",
  "timestampSeconds": 1756400000,
  "namespace": "org.siros.bbs",
  "key": "1849302113",
  "value": "<opaque string>"
}
```

- Reduction MUST set `S.extensions[namespace][key]` to `value`.
- A `value` of `null` is a tombstone: reduction MUST delete the key.
- Merge resolution is last-write-wins per `(namespace, key)`, ordered by
  `timestampSeconds` and, where equal, by `eventId`. The tiebreak is
  REQUIRED.
- Tombstones MUST survive event-history folding for at least the maximum
  permitted time between folds (§6.1.5).

*Non-normative illustration — reduction, total over unknown namespaces:*

```typescript
function extensionsReducer(state: Extensions = {}, e: WalletSessionEvent): Extensions {
  if (e.type !== "set_extension") return state;
  const ns = { ...(state[e.namespace] ?? {}) };
  if (e.value === null) delete ns[e.key];
  else ns[e.key] = e.value;
  return { ...state, [e.namespace]: ns };
}
```

*Non-normative illustration — merge, with the required tiebreak:*

```typescript
const setExtensionStrategy: MergeStrategy = (_mbesv, a, b) =>
  deduplicateBy(
    a.concat(b)
      .filter(e => e.type === "set_extension")
      // Descending, so deduplicateBy (which keeps the first occurrence)
      // retains the newest event per key.
      .sort(compareBy(e => [-e.timestampSeconds, -e.eventId])),
    e => `${e.namespace}\u0000${e.key}`,
  );
```

Folding an `lww` namespace is order-independent: for a given key the result
is the value of the greatest `(timestampSeconds, eventId)` among its events,
whether a client folds a prefix of the history or all of it. This property
does not extend to `events` mode.

#### 6.1.5 Peers beyond the fold horizon

A peer that has not synchronised within the fold horizon no longer shares a
reachable common ancestor, and no correct merge exists for any part of the
state.

- Implementations MUST NOT silently reconcile such histories.
- When no common ancestor is found, the implementation MUST surface the
  divergence and let the user choose which wallet is authoritative.
- Concatenating the two histories produces an invalid event chain and MUST
  NOT be treated as a merge result.

*Non-normative illustration:*

```typescript
const base = await findMergeBase(local, remote);
if (base === null) {
  // Not an error to report and not a merge to attempt: the user decides.
  throw new DivergedBeyondFoldHorizon({ local, remote });
}
return mergeFrom(base, local, remote);
```

#### 6.1.6 Versions and dependencies

A namespace identifier MAY carry a version suffix (`org.siros.bbs/v2`). A
versioned namespace is independent of its predecessor: its own registry
entry, merge mode and state.

- Clients MUST NOT assume support for one version implies support for
  another.
- An entity's state lives under whichever version was current when the
  entity was created. New entities MUST be written to the newest version the
  creating client supports.
- Clients MUST NOT be required to migrate extension state between versions.
  A container MAY hold several versions indefinitely.
- A client MUST NOT delete state belonging to a version it does not support.
- Where a newer version's state is derivable from the older, that
  namespace's registration MAY specify a migration, which MUST be performed
  only by a client supporting both versions.

If a namespace's correct processing depends on another namespace — such that
reducing its events while ignoring the other's would produce wrong state —
its registration MUST declare that dependency, and a client supporting the
dependent namespace MUST also support the one it depends on.

#### 6.1.7 Namespace registry

| Namespace | Owner | Mode | Entry key | Value | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `org.siros.wscd` | WSCD plugins (native SDKs) | `lww` | `kid` | Key metadata needed to address a key created on a roaming authenticator: credential handle, public key, plugin identity. Never private key material | — |
| `org.siros.bbs` | Blind BBS credentials (native SDKs) | `lww` | credential id | Blinding factor, committed messages, bound key binding public keys, and the key handles needed to exercise the key binding private keys | `org.siros.wscd` |
| `org.siros.oid4vci.refresh` | OID4VCI renewal (native SDKs) | `lww` | `batchId` | `refresh_token` and the DPoP key it is bound to | — |

### 6.2 Legacy top-level extension fields (deprecated)

Native SDKs released before §6.1 write two top-level fields under `S`:
`wscdCredentials`, keyed by WSCD plugin ID, and `credentialRefreshTokens`,
keyed by stringified `batchId`. Neither was described by a published version
of this document.

- Readers MAY accept both for migration.
- Writers MUST NOT emit them. The namespaces in §6.1.7 replace them.

## 7. Legacy Compatibility Rules

`wallet-frontend` accepts legacy containers where PRF/password entries directly contain wrapped main keys (`mainKey` symmetric wrapping style) and may upgrade them to asymmetric encapsulation style.

Normative behavior:

- Readers MAY accept legacy formats.
- Writers SHOULD emit asymmetric format (`mainKey` + encapsulation keypair per entry).

## 8. Concurrency and Sync

Backend optimistic concurrency is part of privateData lifecycle:

- Clients SHOULD use `X-Private-Data-If-Match` with backend ETag (`X-Private-Data-ETag`).
- On `412 Precondition Failed`, clients SHOULD reconcile by re-fetching remote privateData and merging according to wallet event-history rules before retrying.

## 9. Reference Implementation Pointers

- `wallet-frontend/src/services/keystore.ts`
- `wallet-frontend/src/services/WalletStateSchemaVersion1.ts`
- `wallet-frontend/src/services/WalletStateSchemaVersion3.ts`
- `wallet-frontend/src/util.ts`

Design rationale, the evidence behind these rules, and a comparison with the
typed-collection approach of `wwWallet/wallet-frontend#751` are in
[`docs/EXTENSIONS-DESIGN.md`](docs/EXTENSIONS-DESIGN.md). That document is
non-normative.
